The routine that adds a segment to the memory structure consumes most of
the execution time of the program. The case where a segment identifier
can be resused is very speedy, but the case where a new segment must be
allocated is *not* optimized very well. That case requires more amd64
instructions than are required by all the other cases of all the other
um instructions.

Although this routine is more complicated than others in this program,
the memory data structure is a pointer-to-struct type, which means that
accessing elements of the struct required dereferences. Furthrmore, the
memory segments are stored in a private array, which means that accessing
a location in segemented memory requires at least two dereferences.

We spent  6 hours analyzing the problem.  We spent 10 hours solving
the problem.

On a personal note, this was a really fun assignment! We are glad we
had the opportunity to squeze performance out of our program.
